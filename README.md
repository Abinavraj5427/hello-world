# hello-world
This is a practice hello-world repository for Google code-in.
I am in 10th grade, and I am participating in Google code-in to improve my development skills and grow in knowledge. I play a lot of tennis and participate in various computer science competitions. I also enjoy chemistry and math and am looking forward to study in those fields as well.
